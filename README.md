# Flashcard Generator

This is a tool that creates digital or printable flashcards for studying purposes. It's useful for memorization and learning by repetition. Users can input questions and answers or content on each side of the flashcard, and the generator creates a set of cards that can be used for self-paced learning or quizzing. It's commonly employed for language learning, vocabulary building, and various educationalÂ topics.
